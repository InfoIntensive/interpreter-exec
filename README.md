# Cequel Executable for Windows

Cequel's purpose is to immitate the pseudocode programming language commonly used in Romanian high schools to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming in their 9th-grade curriculum. The executable project's purpose is making the language available to students on Windows machines without the need to depend on the InfoIntensive learning platform, as well as serving as a testing tool for the development of Cequel's [interpreting library](https://github.com/InfoIntensive/interpreter-lib).

## Getting Started

Building and running the project required the interpreter library being present in the same folder as the executable. The interpreter library can be found [here](https://github.com/InfoIntensive/interpreter-lib)
